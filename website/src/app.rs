By holding regular meetings and discussing updates from team members, I contribute to ensuring that the project progresses smoothly and efficiently while maintaining the highest standards of quality and innovation.".into(),

This updated tool allowed analysts to select specific data sets for processing and visualize range-doppler maps for thorough review. To further aid analysis, I implemented an angle of arrival estimation algorithm, enabling users to identify and visualize the estimated angle of arrival for areas of interest on the range-dopler map.".into(),
                    "Furthermore, I addressed the previous issue of tool crashes with large datasets by improving the binary file IQ parser. I introduced a just-in-time approach that only reads in header files to gather the necessary information to parse IQ binary until that specific set of data is needed. Additionally, I implemented an LRU caching algorithm to allow for speedy recall of recent pieces of data.".into(),

I actively participated in the technical documentation process, playing a crucial role in Model Design Reviews (MDRs) at every stage of the project. This commitment to thorough documentation ensured that our work met the highest standards and was easily understood by all stakeholders.".into(),

Since then, I consistently strive to maintain this high level of excellence in my work. Moreover, I take an active role in mentoring and training other engineers, fostering a culture of growth and knowledge sharing within the team. My dedication to excellence, leadership abilities, and commitment to innovation make me a valuable asset to the Emerging Capabilities division at Northrop Grumman, as I continue my work with the company.".into(),

These innovative tools enabled us to identify a critical bottleneck in the starch dewatering process, where the Merco centrifuges were running 10 baume on underflow. This issue led to slow cycle times on Reinvelds. However, by implementing a few strategic mechanical changes, we achieved a new record of 2.05 million pounds of starch dried in a single day.".into(),
