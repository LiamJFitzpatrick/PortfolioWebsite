After graduating, I joined Ingredionâ€™s Global Training for Operations (GTO) program, designed to develop high-potential talent for leadership roles.

At the Kansas City facility, I worked as a Process Engineer with responsibilities spanning Treating, Drying, and Packaging departments, focusing on optimizing processes and integrating data systems. Later, in Indianapolis, I served as Process Lead for the Co-Products department, where I oversaw daily operations, emphasizing safety and equipment reliability.

A key achievement was developing data visualization tools that enabled actionable insights across facilities. These tools helped identify a bottleneck in the starch dewatering process related to Merco centrifuge underflow, leading to targeted mechanical adjustments that resulted in a record throughput of 2.05 million pounds of starch dried in a single day.

I managed multiple process improvement projects under $500,000, including equipment refurbishments and installation of real-time level detection sensors to enhance process monitoring. Additionally, I led the implementation of an RF Gen barcoding system, transforming inventory tracking with real-time production line visibility. I supported adoption through new standard procedures, employee training, and project dashboards displaying live data for management and operators.

Overall, my tenure at Ingredion sharpened my skills in process optimization, data-driven decision-making, and operational technology integration within a manufacturing environment.
